# How to Fix and Display Your GitHub Snake Animation

Based on your screenshot, I can see that the snake animation links are visible but not rendering properly. Here's how to fix this issue:

## Quick Solution

1. **Check Your Current Implementation**:
   - Your README has both Markdown-style image links and HTML tags
   - GitHub may have trouble rendering these consistently

2. **Fix the Snake Animation with These Steps**:

   A. **Use a Trusted Source for the Snake Animation**:
   
   Replace the current snake animation section in your README with:

   ```html
   <div align="center">
     <h2>🐍 My Contributions 🐍</h2>
     <br>
     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platane/platane/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg" alt="Snake animation" width="100%">
     <br><br><br>
   </div>
   ```

   B. **Fix Your GitHub Actions Workflow**:

   Make sure your `.github/workflows/snake.yml` file has exactly this content:

   ```yaml
   name: Generate Snake Animation

   on:
     schedule:
       # Runs at midnight every day
       - cron: '0 0 * * *'
     workflow_dispatch:   # Allows manual triggering
       
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v3
           
         - name: Generate Snake
           uses: Platane/snk@v3
           with:
             github_user_name: harihara04sudhan  # Your username here
             outputs: |
               dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg
               dist/github-contribution-grid-snake-dark.svg?palette=github-dark
         
         - name: Push to output branch
           uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v3.1.0
           with:
             target_branch: output
             build_dir: dist
           env:
             GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

   C. **Run the Workflow Manually**:
   
   1. Go to your GitHub repository
   2. Click on the "Actions" tab
   3. Find "Generate Snake Animation" workflow
   4. Click "Run workflow" button
   5. Select your main branch and run

   D. **Ensure Repository Permissions**:
   
   1. Go to your repository's Settings
   2. Go to Actions > General
   3. Make sure "Read and write permissions" is selected under "Workflow permissions"

3. **If That Still Doesn't Work**:

   As a last resort, use a simpler implementation:

   ```html
   <div align="center">
     <h2>🐍 My Contributions 🐍</h2>
     <br>
     <img src="https://github.com/1999AZZAR/1999AZZAR/blob/readme/resources/img/grid-snake.svg" alt="Snake animation">
     <br><br><br>
   </div>
   ```

This should resolve the issue with your snake animation not displaying properly in your GitHub profile README.
